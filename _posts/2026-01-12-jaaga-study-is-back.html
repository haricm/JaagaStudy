<p>From Jan 19th to March 13th, we’ll be testing a virtual extension of the Mars College Creative AI program. We aren’t
    following a rigid syllabus; we’re here to get hands-on with emerging tools and see what we can build together in a
    shared, remote space. This nine-week virtual cohort is an experimental pilot.</p>

<p>Join us in this shared, remote space to see what we can build together.</p>
